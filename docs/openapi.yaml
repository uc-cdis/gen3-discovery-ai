    # Overview
    
    API for querying about specific pre-configured topics. A topic 
    has a configured chain of actions that eventually query an LLM and may 
    contain a knowledge store of documents related to the topic (which may be used to
    include augmentation of the query).

    At this time, the available configured chain(s) are based on a
    [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401).
    Queries will be augmented with relevant information from a 
    knowledge library for that topic. Upon receiving a query, additional information is 
    retrieved from the library, relevancy compared to
    user query, and a prompt to a foundational AI LLM model is augmented with the 
    additional context from the knowledge library. The foundational model then generates a response.

    In the future, more configured chains may enable alternative architectures or just
    different versions of RAGs with different models/services.

Intensive care unit admissions occurred early and were associated with protracted hospital stays. Survivors often required new health care services or respiratory support at discharge.The PETAL Network central institutional review board at Vanderbilt University and the institutional review boards at each participating hospital approved the study or determined that the study was exempt from review.Instructions for requesting individual-level data are available on BioData Catalyst at https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/resources/data/.
